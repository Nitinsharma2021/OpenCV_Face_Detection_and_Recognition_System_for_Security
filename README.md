# OpenCV Face Detection and Recognition System for Security

Unlock your device using face recognition. This project demonstrates a face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. While convenient, remember that face recognition might have limitations and potential security risks.

## Features

- Capture and analyze face images through the device's camera.
- Train a model using the captured images.
- Recognize and identify faces using the trained model.
- Save captured images with date and time in a locked session.

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes and not recommended for secure authentication. Use more secure methods for sensitive data and devices.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python, OpenCV, and required libraries.
2. Capture face images using the provided code.
3. Train the model with the captured images.
4. Use the model to recognize and unlock based on detected faces.

## Saving Locked Images

During locked sessions, the system captures images of potential users. These images are saved in a separate folder, labeled with the date and time of the capture. This folder structure helps you identify and manage locked images efficiently.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to improve the code, add features, or fix bugs.

## Normal system 
<p> this Project is Deivide into three files </p>
<ul> In First part the Capture the Picture and save it. </ul>
<ul> In Second Part the Model gets trained properly with the datasets of images.</ul>
<ul> In Third Part the Model gets trained and predict the face and recogination it properly. </ul>
