#  Face-Unlock-and-Lock-Recogination-System
<h1> Can you unlock face recognition with a picture on your device </h1>
<p> When using face recognition to unlock your device, your phone could be unlocked by someone or something that looks like your image. The possibility of the exceptional cases where the current detector can mistake fake image as a live input, the decision logic was already applied to strengthen the anti-spoofing function.

However, there are technical limitations in coping with all spoofing attempts such as high-resolution images.

Thus we do not recommend the usage of face recognition for high-security authentication applications. As Face recognition is less secure than Pattern, Pin, or Password, we recommend using Fingerprint recognition, Pattern, Pin, or Password to lock the device.
Additionally, if you use your face as a screen lock method, your face cannot be used to unlock the screen when turning on the device. You must unlock the screen using a pattern, PIN, or password you set when registering the face. Be careful not to forget your pattern, PIN, or password. </p>

<p> this Project is Deivide into three files </p>
<ul> In First part the Capture the Picture and save it. </ul>
<ul> In Second Part the Model gets trained properly with the datasets of images. </ul>
<ul> In Third Part the Model gets trained and predict the face and recogination it properly. </ul>
